The 1950s were, to put it very simply, “another era”. One needs only to take a faint glimpse at the grand opening poster that greeted you as soon as the page loaded to see that the people of that age were both high and drunk at all times to be stupid enough to accept the ludicrus invitations to eternal happiness proposed by the caricature of the beloved Disneyland, or perhaps they believed the slogans to be mere hilarious, satirical comments coming from a family-friendly amusement park.  This, however, is false; take everything you see from this point at face-value.  This is your last chance to turn back.  However fantastical the bleak truth of the matter appears, I have firsthand witnessed the evils of STARR PARK, their tyrannical plans that have been thwarted forever, and will forever be thwarted, yet never have been, nor will be.  This is the fate the rebels have been condemned to for their attempts to overthrow what was, with no exaggeration, an attempt for global tyranny, an attempt that proved fruitless throughout time itself.  

“What is this?” “Why am I getting this?” Are two questions I predict you’ve asked yourself.  To answer these, to temporarily sate your gluttony for the truth, before I demonstrate the ramifications of these things, I should probably start from the beginning.
